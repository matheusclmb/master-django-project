    <h3>About Master-Django:</h3>
    <p>

        href="https://github.com/matheusclmb"
        target="_blank">@clmb</a
      >) with the purpouse to learn about the Django framework and to help me find my first job in this area.
    </p>
    <p>
      PS: This project is to check my back-end knowledge, so bear with the
      front-end for now! ðŸ˜…
    </p>
    <h3>Applications:</h3>
    <p>This project comes with 5 "Applications":</p>
    <ul class="applications">
      <li>
        <span class="li-title"> Login/Sign up System </span>- Using Django Model
        and Django Auth, you have to be logged in to enter the site. You can bypass though.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="li-title"> Weather App </span>- Using OpenWeather API, you
        can check the weather from cities you choose.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="li-title">Movie Generator </span>- Using TMDB (The Movie
        Database) API, the site will generate a random movie for you. Limited to
        2.000 movies
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="li-title">Todo List </span>- Using Django Model, you can
        create a todo list and delete. With registration date and due date.
      </li>
      <li>

        contact me using the form and django will foward to my email.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Difficulties i had:</h3>
    <p>
      While i'm still learning i faced a lot of problems that i managed to fix
      by searching docs and googling
    </p>
    <ul class="problems">
      <li>
       <span class="li-title"> Weather App </span> - When user typed a city that didn't exist, it would return
        a KeyError and breaking until you delete the entry in the database.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="li-title">Movie Generator </span> - Because TMDB have more than 70.000 movie entries and lot of
        them were deleted but stayed in API, it would return a custom HttpResponse 404 that i couldn't bypass.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    <p>
      Django is a strong and fun framework. I still have a lot to learn and to
      refine. I will focus and practice more, both Django and Django Rest
      Framework.
